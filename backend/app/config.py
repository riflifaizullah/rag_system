# Confirmed live this needs a RAM ceiling, not just a CPU-count one: on this

# and the real full-corpus ingest (1149 files, a much larger and more varied
# set than any small-batch test covered) repeatedly died with MemoryError
# under that many concurrent OCR/VLM-heavy workers -- three fix attempts
# chasing an unrelated, real-but-minor pdfminer edge case (a malformed
# font's CMap parsing) never actually resolved it, because the true
# bottleneck was system-wide memory exhaustion from over-parallelization,
# not that code path specifically; the crash kept surfacing there only
# because parsing an embedded CID font is common early per-page work that
# happens to need a fresh allocation right when the system is already
# critically low, not because that one file was uniquely broken. Budgets
# RAM per worker against currently-available RAM (via psutil, reserving
# headroom for the main process's embedding model, Chroma/sqlite, and
# Ollama) and takes whichever of that or the CPU-count bound is lower, so
# a future higher-RAM machine still scales up by CPU count while a tight
# one like this backs off automatically instead of repeating this
# incident.
#
# First attempt at this budget (1GB/worker, 2GB reserved) still resolved
# to 6 workers on a re-run once some RAM had freed up between attempts,
# and confirmed live via Get-Counter '\Memory\Available MBytes' that left
# only ~1.4GB truly available with those 6 workers just barely started (no
# heavy pages yet) -- real observed per-worker footprint is already
# ~650-800MB before doing any substantial OCR/VLM work, well above the 1GB
# budget's assumed margin for that plus in-flight spikes. Raised to 1.5GB/
# worker and 3GB reserved to leave real headroom for large-page spikes
