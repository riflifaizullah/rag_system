"""Embedding-based retrieval, scoped heading lookups, named-document
targeting, ambiguity detection, and deterministic broad-category listing.

Carries fixes for known-bugs #1, #2, #7 from the rebuild spec:
  #1 retrieve() takes an optional source_filter and turns it into a Chroma
     `where` clause -- naming a document actually constrains the k-NN search.
  #2 heading lookups are always scoped to specific source(s), never the
     whole corpus.
  #7 broad-category word selection tries candidates in the order they
     appear in the question, not via unordered set iteration.

Later additions, layered onto the same retrieve() pipeline in this order:
  - reranking (get_reranker()/rerank()): fetch a wider embedding candidate
    set, then have a cross-encoder score (question, chunk) pairs jointly --
    catches cases where several near-identical boilerplate clauses tie on
    pure embedding similarity but only one is topically on point.
  - exact-identifier boost (_exact_identifier_boost()): overrides both of
    the above outright when the question names a specific clause/section
    number, because dense retrieval still doesn't key strongly on a literal
    number difference between otherwise-similar clauses.
  - own-document-code boost (_own_document_code_boost()): when a question
    is scoped to exactly one document, ensures a chunk containing that
    document's OWN full document number (derived from its filename, the
    same real numbering convention every indexed file follows) is present
    in the retrieved set. Confirmed live: a chunk from a DIFFERENT document
    referenced inside the scoped one (e.g. a related policy listed in a
    "Daftar Lampiran" appendix, with an incomplete/placeholder-style
    number) out-ranked the scoped document's own real title-block chunk --
    both are short, similarly-formatted "NOMOR / BERLAKU TMT" snippets the
    cross-encoder can't tell apart from text alone, since doing so needs
    document-structure awareness (this is the cover page vs. this is an
    appendix entry), not just topical similarity.
  - the shorthand-matching regex (_build_shorthand_patterns()), the
    identifier-boost pattern, and the broad-category word detection
    (_category_candidates_from_headings()) are all built from real indexed
    content (filenames / retrieved chunk text / real headings) rather than
    a hardcoded vocabulary, on the theory that anything corpus-specific
    (document-type words, section-keyword words) will silently go stale
    the moment this is ported to a differently-named real document set.
    GENERIC_IDENTIFIER_PATTERN (ambiguity detection) has NOT been
    generalized the same way yet -- still a fixed (pasal|lampiran|bab)
    list, same latent risk, just not hit by a real test case so far.
  - enumerate-intent routing (broad_category_listing(), document_type_
    listing()): "list all X" / "apa saja X" / "berapa banyak X" questions
    are answered by reading the real heading/document index directly and
    formatting deterministically, never through retrieve() at all --
    similarity search only returns the *most relevant* top-k chunks, never
    a completeness guarantee, so an enumerate question routed through it
    can (and did, live) silently return a partial list.
  - hybrid search (_bm25_search(), reciprocal rank fusion in retrieve()):
    a sparse/keyword BM25 pass runs alongside the embedding pass for the
    "specific"/"broad" paths (enumerate bypasses retrieval entirely), since
    embeddings alone can rank a chunk with the wrong literal clause number
    as more similar than the chunk with the right one on short,
    structurally-repetitive legal text.

    real corpus file, whose filename and cover page claim one document
    (C-035) but whose page 3 is an intact title-block table for a
    completely different document (C-023). This is a source-data mixing
    problem (wrong pages assembled into the PDF at the source), not
    something ingestion/retrieval code can fix -- this only detects and
    reports it for human review.

    A real citation of another document's number in ordinary body prose
    (a REFERENSI list) is common and NOT flagged -- only a foreign code
    found inside its own short, title-block-SHAPED chunk (multiple
    colon-separated "Label : Value" fields, the same structural signature
    used elsewhere in this file for detecting real title-blocks) counts,
    since a real citation reads as a sentence, not a standalone field
    table.

    Not every real filename embeds its own document code (confirmed live:
    the exact file this was built to catch, "27._TKI_Portal_STK_Online.pdf",
    is named descriptively, not by code, so _source_document_code() on the
    filename alone returns None and this check would silently never fire
    for it) -- when the filename doesn't give a code, the code found in the
    lowest-page title-block-shaped chunk is used as the reference instead,
    since a document's own real identity is reliably on its earliest pages
    (the same assumption _own_document_code_boost() already relies on).

    Known open limitation, confirmed live: on the exact motivating file
    above, this still doesn't fire, because that file's own cover page has
    NO colon-separated fields at all (just plain title lines), so
    _is_title_block() never recognizes ANY of its chunks as a title-block
    -- own_code stays None and the whole check returns empty. Detecting a

# never designed to guarantee completeness, it returns the *most relevant*
# chunks, not *all* of them. "Sebutkan semua"/"list all" phrasing already
# routed around retrieval via broad_category_listing() below, but a
# differently-phrased version of the same request ("apa saja pasal yang
# ada di kontrak 102") used none of the recognized trigger words and fell
# straight through to the incomplete top-k path -- confirmed live: the
# exact same question worded as "list all Pasal..." returned all 22 real
# headings, while "apa saja pasal..." returned None from this function and
# silently fell back to a 4-of-22 answer. Expanded triggers below close
# that specific gap; the deeper fix is that ANY of these trigger phrases
# combined with a real structural-element word must short-circuit before
# retrieval ever runs, which generate_answer() already does by checking
# this function first.
